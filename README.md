I primarily code in **Python** as a hobby and officially work with **C/++**.
However, I mainly try to be known with my malware. I do a lot of GDI (mostly visual, without MBR Overwrite) but also ransomware and other for educational purposes. 🛠

I have a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@EnderMalware/), go take a look !

### What's the project you're most proud of?
The project I'm most proud of is my very first GDI coded in C++. It was my first time coding in C++ and I was very proud of my accomplishment.
